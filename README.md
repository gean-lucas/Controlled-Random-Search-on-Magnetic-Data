# Controlled-Random-Search-on-Magnetic-Data

This is a python notebook version from the fortran project that I uploaded in my github repository. 
It is a Controlled Random Search implementation applyed in the inversion of a sintetic 2D profile magnetometric data generated from a dipole.
I believe that the cell flow of a jupyter notebook makes it much easier to understand.
